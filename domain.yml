# General questions

  utter_definition_STD:
  - text: "Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), also known as sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are very common. Millions of new infections occur every year in the United States.\nSTDs pass from one person to another through vaginal, oral, and anal sex. They also can spread through intimate physical contact like heavy petting, though this is not very common.\nSTDs donâ€™t always cause symptoms or may only cause mild symptoms. Therefore, it is possible to have an infection and not know it. That is why getting an STD test is important if you are having sex. If you receive a positive STD diagnosis, know that all are treatable with medicine and some are curable entirely.\nSTDs are preventable. If you have sex, know how to protect yourself and your sex partner(s) from STDs." #"Here goes the definition of STD"
