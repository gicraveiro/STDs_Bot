  utter_definition_STD:
  - text: "Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), also known as sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are very common. Millions of new infections occur every year in the United States.\n\n\nSTDs pass from one person to another through vaginal, oral, and anal sex. They also can spread through intimate physical contact like heavy petting, though this is not very common.\n\n\nSTDs don’t always cause symptoms or may only cause mild symptoms. Therefore, it is possible to have an infection and not know it. That is why getting an STD test is important if you are having sex. If you receive a positive STD diagnosis, know that all are treatable with medicine and some are curable entirely.\n\n\nSTDs are preventable. If you have sex, know how to protect yourself and your sex partner(s) from STDs.\n\n\n"

  utter_prevention_STD:
  - text: "The CDC website lists measures to reduce or eliminate the risks of STDs. Here are all the topics they included:\n\n\n  - Use Condoms: Correct and consistent use of the male latex condom is highly effective in reducing STD transmission. Use a condom every time you have anal, vaginal, or oral sex.\n\n\n  - Vaccination: Vaccines are safe, effective, and recommended ways to prevent hepatitis B and HPV.\n\n\n  - Get tested: Many STDs don’t have symptoms, but they can still cause health problems. The only way to know for sure if you have an STD is to get tested.\n\n\n  - Talk with your partner: Talk with your sex partner(s) about STDs and staying safe before having sex. It might be uncomfortable to start the conversation, but protecting your health is your responsibility.\n\n\n  - Reduce Number of Sex Partners: Reducing your number of sex partners can decrease your risk for STDs. It is still important that you and your partner get tested, and that you share your test results with one another.\n\n\n  - Mutual Monogamy: Mutual monogamy means that you agree to be sexually active with only one person, who has agreed to be sexually active only with you. Being in a long-term mutually monogamous relationship with an uninfected partner is one of the most reliable ways to avoid STDs. But you must both be certain you are not infected with STDs. It is important to have an open and honest conversation with your partner.\n\n\n  - Abstinence: The most reliable way to avoid infection is to not have sex (i.e., anal, vaginal or oral).\n\n\n"

  # condom allergy: If you have latex allergies, synthetic non-latex condoms can be used. But it is important to note that these condoms have higher breakage rates than latex condoms. Natural membrane condoms are not recommended for STD prevention.
  # vaccination: HPV vaccination is recommended for preteens ages 11 or 12 (or can start at age 9) and everyone through age 26, if not vaccinated already. Vaccination is not recommended for everyone older than age 26 years. However, some adults age 27 through 45 years who are not already vaccinated may decide to get the HPV vaccine after speaking with their doctor about their risk for new HPV infections and the possible benefits of vaccination. HPV vaccination in this age range provides less benefit as more people have already been exposed to HPV. You should also get vaccinated for hepatitis B if you were not vaccinated when you were younger.

      If you are sexually active, getting tested for STDs is one of the most important things you can do to protect your health.

      Make sure you have an open and honest conversation about your sexual history and STD testing with your doctor and ask whether you should be tested for STDs.

      Many STDs don’t have symptoms, but they can still cause health problems. The only way to know for sure if you have an STD is to get tested.

  - text: "If you are sexually active, getting tested for STDs is one of the most important things you can do to protect your health. Make sure you have an open and honest conversation about your sexual history and STD testing with your doctor and ask whether you should be tested for STDs.\n\n\nBelow is a brief overview of STD testing recommendations:\n\n\n  - All adults and adolescents from ages 13 to 64 should be tested at least once for HIV.\n\n\n  - All sexually active women younger than 25 years should be tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia every year. Women 25 years and older with risk factors such as new or multiple sex partners or a sex partner who has an STD should also be tested for gonorrhea and chlamydia every year.\n\n\n  - Everyone who is pregnant should be tested for syphilis, HIV, hepatitis B, and hepatitis C starting early in pregnancy. Those at risk for infection should also be tested for chlamydia and gonorrhea starting early in pregnancy. Repeat testing may be needed in some cases.\n\n\n  - Anyone who engages in sexual behaviors that could place them at risk for infection or shares injection drug equipment should get tested for HIV at least once a year.\n\n\n  - People who have had oral or anal sex should talk with their healthcare provider about throat and rectal testing options.\n\n\n  - All sexually active gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men should be tested:\n\n\n    - At least once a year for syphilis, chlamydia, and gonorrhea. Those who have multiple or anonymous partners should be tested more frequently (e.g., every 3 to 6 months).\n\n\n    - At least once a year for HIV and may benefit from more frequent HIV testing (e.g., every 3 to 6 months).\n\n\n    - At least once a year for hepatitis C, if living with HIV.\n\n\n"
